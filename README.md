# Real-Time-Process-Monitoring-Dashboard
The Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard is a tool designed for system administrators to monitor and manage system resources efficiently. This project aims to provide real-time insights into CPU usage, memory consumption, and process states, enabling administrators to detect potential performance bottlenecks and make informed decisions.
The project integrates the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling algorithm to manage process scheduling efficiently. Additionally, it compares EDF with other scheduling algorithms to analyse performance based on various parameters such as CPU utilization, deadline miss rate, and response time. The system will feature a graphical interface to display real-time statistics and trends in resource usage.
